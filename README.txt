1) All the necessary files are present here including
   ML model, Dataset etc.

2) So, to test everything you'll need to install Flask.
   To do that, open cmd/terminal and type 
   "pip install flask"

3) To run the local server type "python aviii.py" in the
   terminal. Make sure to navigate to the mini project's 
   folder before running.

4) While the server is running you might encounter some 404 
   errors in the terminal. Ignore them.

5) To use a different ML model, Delete the .ipynb and .pkl
   files. Rerun the new model. Make sure that the name of 
   the pkl file is "testmodel.pkl"

*NOTE : You cannot directly run index.html as the 
	css,js and other assets wouldn't load.
	You have to run the server to test the application.*
